# 60_min_countdown Prop

## Function Overview
This is a multi-step countdown timer. It will count down from 60 and display on a 4 digit 7 segment display until either it has reached 0 or when all the conditions are met. The conditions are Flip, Plug, and Key pass. This is designed so that you have have modulus Arduinos attached to this main core and have various additional steps to solve. For this one I have manual switches that need to be flipped in a given order, 5 key switches that need to be all turned on, multiple audio cord plugs that need to be inserted in the correct order, and a passkey terminal that needs the correct key code. once the correct voltages are sent to the correct pins the timer will shut off and the audio buzzer pin will create a chime.
